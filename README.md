Genetic algorithm with neural networks
Using feedforward neural networks with 3 hidden nodes (2 inputs), and 2 outputs (2 inputs)
1 hidden layer
The 4 inputs are:
  -The agents X distance to the pipe
  -The agents vertical distances to the top and bottom pipe
  -The agents Y velocity
Using sigmoid activation function and also the
